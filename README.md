# Run C

Sometimes you do not want to use an IDE but you want to work on some C code.
This utility will allow you to run code as such:

runc someFile.c

A temporary executable will be created and run if the code compiles. The executable is then deleted. This allows you to make changes to your C code and quickly test changes.
